# Introduction

## Welcome to the ColdBox Mail Services

Sending emails doesn't have to be complicated or archaic. The ColdBox Mail Services (`cbmailservices`) module will allow you to send emails in a _fluent_ and _abstract_ way in multiple protocols for many environments in a **single cohesive API.** The supported protocols are:

* **CFMail** - Traditional `cfmail` sending
* **File** - Write emails to disk
* **InMemory** - Store email mementos in an array. Perfect for testing.
* **Null** - Ignores emails sent to it.
* **Postmark** - Send via the PostMark API Service ([https://postmarkapp.com/](https://postmarkapp.com/))
* **Mailgun** - Send via the MailGun API Service ([https://www.mailgun.com/](https://www.mailgun.com/))

It also sports tons of useful features for mail sending:

* Async Mail
* Mail Queues
* Mail merging of variables
* Mail attachments, headers, and parameters
* View and Layout+View rendering for mail
* Mail Tracking
* Multiple mailers
* Success and Error callbacks
* `Mailable@cbmailservices` delegate for adding mailing traits to objects.
* So Much More!

```javascript
newMail( 
	to         : "email@email.com",
	from       : "no_reply@ortussolutions.com",
	subject    : "Mail Services Rock",
	type       : "html", // Can be plain, html, or text
	bodyTokens : { 
		user    : "Luis", 
		product : "ColdBox", 
		link    : event.buildLink( 'home' )
	}
)
.setBody("
    <p>Dear @user@,</p>
    <p>Thank you for downloading @product@, have a great day!</p>
    <p><a href='@link@'>@link@</a></p> 
")
.addAttachment( expandPath( "/tmp/reports/report.pdf" ) )
.setReadReceipt( "myemail@email.com" )
.send()
.onSuccess( function( result, mail ){
	// Process the success
})
.onError( function( result, mail ){
	// Process the error
});
```
